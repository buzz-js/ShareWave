# ShareWave

A portal that allows users to share text, images and videos. It includes a rating system as well as a comment section under each post.

## Description

Project currently still in development. It is my most ambitious application this far, it includes a lot of asynchronous requests and conditional rendering.

The main features are:

- Email/Google sign in using Firebase
- Account page with user details, posts and password change option
- Adding text/image/video posts
- Post rating and comments
- Admin/User permissions

## Tech stack

- React - Hooks / Router / Context
- Firebase - Authentication / Firestore DB / Storage
- Material UI
- SCSS

## Installation

Currently no way to launch locally due to hidden API values. Project will be hosted when finished.
